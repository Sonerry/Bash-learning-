# **Ä°ntroduction to BASH**
What is Bash ? :thinking:

**Bash** is a [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell "Unix shell") and command language written by 
[Brian Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer) "Brian Fox (computer programmer)") for the [GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project "GNU Project") as a [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software") replacement for the Bourne shell. The shell's name is an acronym for _Bourne Again Shell_, a pun on the name of the [Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell "Bourne shell") that it replaces and the notion of being "[born again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_again "Born again")" . 
First released in 1989, ,it has been used as the default login shell for most [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) distributions and it was one of the first programs [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) ported to Linux, alongside [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection)

Are bash vs shell different?
 while "shell" is a broad term that refers to any program that provides a command-line interface, "Bash" is a specific type of shell that is widely used in Unix/Linux systems.
